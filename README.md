# vertex-cover-playground
A tool for solving, creating, and sharing vertex-cover-problems.

# Motivation
This tool was (unoffically) built for use with a lesson on one-way functions in the Code.org Computer Science Principles curriculum.

The first part allows users to solve the main example problem that is included in the Code.org lesson. The problem is a vertex-cover problem but is framed as a problem requiring the strategic placement of wifi hotspots to ensure that everyone in a neighborhood has wifi access. 

Additional problems have been added by the creator of the site as well as users of the site (see the next point). These can be accessed by clicking "Try Another Graph" and selecting a size.

The second part ("Create your own") allows users to create their own problem that then get added to the database. They get a code / link that they can share. 

There is also a password protected admin view for approving user created puzzles so that they show up when users request random puzzles.
