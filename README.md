# vertex-cover-playground
A tool for solving and creating vertex-cover-problems.

# Motivation
This tool was (unoffically) built for use with a lesson on one-way functions in the Code.org Computer Science Principles curriculum.

As of right now, it allows users to solve the main example problem that is included in the Code.org lesson. The problem is a vertex-cover problem but is framed as a problem requiring the strategic placement of wifi hotspots to ensure that everyone in a neighborhood has wifi access.

# In Development
The main reason for this tool is to allow students to create their own vertex-cover problem and understand how it exemplifies a one-way function. This feature is currently in development.
