# vertex-cover-playground
A tool for solving and creating vertex-cover-problems.

# Motivation
This tool was (unoffically) built for use with a lesson on one-way functions in the Code.org Computer Science Principles curriculum.

The first part allows users to solve the main example problem that is included in the Code.org lesson. The problem is a vertex-cover problem but is framed as a problem requiring the strategic placement of wifi hotspots to ensure that everyone in a neighborhood has wifi access.

The second part allows users to create their own problem

# Still To Be Developed
* Update the css with media queries to make the site mobile friendly.
* Create a database to store data for user created puzzles. Each puzzle could be assigned a code and link that could be used for sharing the user created puzzles.
